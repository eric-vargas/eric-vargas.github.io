      <p>Computers, at their most basic level, store information in bits&mdash;a series of on and off states represented by ones and zeroes. Using this binary language, the information in images, audio, video, text, and other files can be saved and shared. This principle is the basis of all computing, including programming. Here Doug Winnie explains the basics of binary: how digital information is represented, encoded, stored, and communicated between computers.<p>
      <p>This course is the first in our Computer Science Principles series, designed around the AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) curriculum. It is a great foundation for anyone, at any age, to prepare for careers in technology and computer science. Lessons in this segment cover the building blocks of computing: binary logic, number systems, text and image encoding, compression, and simple communication protocols. Understanding these basics will help you understand the interplay between hardware, software, data, networks, and the people that use them.</p>

      <p>Computers can do a lot. But it's the Internet that makes them come alive, allowing users to communicate and share data all across the world, over millions of miles, in fractions of a second. The Internet forms the connection underlying all computing, governing how software and hardware&mdash;regardless of vendor&mdash;work together. Here Doug Winnie explains the history of the Internet and the technology underlying the web, including IP addressing, routing, web servers, URLs, and the languages that allow computers to "speak" to each other over the Internet, such as hypertext and HTML. And any conversation about the Internet isn't complete without a mention of security. Doug explains how encryption works and why it's important to keeping your data safe online.</p>

      <p>Programming is what allows us to make computers, devices, and the Internet perform amazing tasks, entertain us, and simplify our lives. While programming seems complicated, every programming challenge can be broken down into sections of code that you can define, control, and even reuse. You can learn the basic concepts of coding without needing to know a specific programming language.</p>
      <p>Join Doug Winnie as he explains the principles of programming and helps you connect to core concepts by exploring three ways that programmers perform their jobs. Doug starts by sharing the history of coding and then dives into functions, values, variables, and parameters used to define actions. He covers capturing input from users, creating conditional tests, using loops with arrays, and object-oriented programming basics. He also takes you beyond programming, into processes like debugging, refactoring, and building iteratively.</p>

      <p>Algorithms are the universal building blocks of programming. They power the software you use every day, whether it's a spreadsheet, a social network, or a driving assistant. Algorithms offer a way to think about programming challenges in plain English, before they are translated into a specific language like C# or JavaScript. In this course, author and developer Joe Marini explains some of the most popular and useful algorithms for searching and sorting information, working with techniques like recursion, and understanding common data structures. He also discusses the performance implications of different algorithms and how to evaluate the performance of a given algorithm. Each algorithm is shown in practice in Python, but the lessons can be applied to any programming language.</p>

      <p>All good software starts with a great design. Object-oriented design helps developers plan applications before they write a single line of code, and break down ideas into reusable and maintainable components. This course focuses on the foundational concepts, teaching them in a fun, interactive way to help you quickly develop your skills. Tag team Olivia and Barron Stone introduce you to the concepts and terms&mdash;objects, classes, abstraction, inheritance, and more&mdash;that you need to get started. They then show how to take the requirements for an app, identify use cases, and map out classes using Universal Modeling Language (UML). The final design can then be translated into code using one of the many popular object-oriented programming languages, such as Java, C#, Ruby, or Python.</p>

      <p>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. This course describes the fundamentals of this web service. Get introduced to the features of Amazon EC2, find out where it is available, and explore purchasing options based on instance preference: reserved, scheduled, spot, or dedicated. Learn how to work with AMI (Amazon Machine Image), how to launch an instance, and how to connect to an instance using Linux, Mac, or Windows.</p>
