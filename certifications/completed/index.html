      <p>Programming is what allows us to make computers, devices, and the Internet perform amazing tasks, entertain us, and simplify our lives. While programming seems complicated, every programming challenge can be broken down into sections of code that you can define, control, and even reuse. You can learn the basic concepts of coding without needing to know a specific programming language.</p>
      <p>Join Doug Winnie as he explains the principles of programming and helps you connect to core concepts by exploring three ways that programmers perform their jobs. Doug starts by sharing the history of coding and then dives into functions, values, variables, and parameters used to define actions. He covers capturing input from users, creating conditional tests, using loops with arrays, and object-oriented programming basics. He also takes you beyond programming, into processes like debugging, refactoring, and building iteratively.</p>

      <p>Computers can do a lot. But it's the Internet that makes them come alive, allowing users to communicate and share data all across the world, over millions of miles, in fractions of a second. The Internet forms the connection underlying all computing, governing how software and hardware—regardless of vendor—work together. Here Doug Winnie explains the history of the Internet and the technology underlying the web, including IP addressing, routing, web servers, URLs, and the languages that allow computers to "speak" to each other over the Internet, such as hypertext and HTML. And any conversation about the Internet isn't complete without a mention of security. Doug explains how encryption works and why it's important to keeping your data safe online.</p>
      <p>This course is the second in our Computer Science Principles series, designed around the AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) curriculum. It is a great foundation for anyone, at any age, to prepare for careers in technology and computer science. Understanding basics like the Internet will help you understand the interplay between hardware, software, data, networks, and the people that use them.</p>

      <p>Computers, at their most basic level, store information in bits—a series of on and off states represented by ones and zeroes. Using this binary language, the information in images, audio, video, text, and other files can be saved and shared. This principle is the basis of all computing, including programming. Here Doug Winnie explains the basics of binary: how digital information is represented, encoded, stored, and communicated between computers.<p>
      <p>This course is the first in our Computer Science Principles series, designed around the AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) curriculum. It is a great foundation for anyone, at any age, to prepare for careers in technology and computer science. Lessons in this segment cover the building blocks of computing: binary logic, number systems, text and image encoding, compression, and simple communication protocols. Understanding these basics will help you understand the interplay between hardware, software, data, networks, and the people that use them.</p>
