      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>On this website, you'll be able to learn more about who I am and what I'm working on these days. Recently, I decided to embark on a new career in real estate, which I'm very excited about it! I also love music of all kinds (especially dance music), and run a website about my favorite DJ, Paul Oakenfold. I've been listening to him for over 20 years now and have built up quite a bit of knowledge about his musical career. I've put this knowledge to work in creating <a href="http://www.oakenfoldmixes.com" target="_blank">OakenfoldMixes.com</a>, which is a site that specializes in documenting and sharing his classic mixes from the 90s.</p>
      <p>I also love learning! It's one of the biggest driving forces in my life. Today, I'm currently studying to get my Colorado real estate license (Associate Broker, FA license), and I expect to have my license by the end of 2020. This will allow me to be a professional in the real estate field and share everything that I'm learning in a big way for my clients. So if you're looking to move anytime soon, to or from Colorado, be sure to keep me in mind as I'd love to put my expertise to work for you!</p>
      <p>These days, I'm also continuing my studies of web development. The internet has always been a big part of my life, and web development allows me to build different projects that not only are fun to make, but that allow me to help contribute to various communities.</p>
      <p>I always enjoy meeting new people and helping others, so if I can help you out in any way, feel free to send me an email or connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-vargas/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>!</p>
      <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit,</p>
      <p>Eric</p>
