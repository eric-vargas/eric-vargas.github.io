      <p>HTML is the programming language that powers the web. And like any language, once you master it, you can begin to create your own content, whether that's simple websites or complex web applications. This course provides an in-depth look at the essentials: the syntax of HTML and best practices for writing and editing your code. Senior staff author James Williamson reviews the structure of a typical HTML document, and shows how to section pages and format your content with HTML. Plus, learn how to create links and lists, and find out how HTML works with CSS and JavaScript to create rich, engaging user experiences. So open a text editor, watch these videos, and begin learning to author HTML the right way.</p>

      <p>Computers, at their most basic level, store information in bits—a series of on and off states represented by ones and zeroes. Using this binary language, the information in images, audio, video, text, and other files can be saved and shared. This principle is the basis of all computing, including programming. Here Doug Winnie explains the basics of binary: how digital information is represented, encoded, stored, and communicated between computers.<p>
      <p>This course is the first in our Computer Science Principles series, designed around the AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) curriculum. It is a great foundation for anyone, at any age, to prepare for careers in technology and computer science. Lessons in this segment cover the building blocks of computing: binary logic, number systems, text and image encoding, compression, and simple communication protocols. Understanding these basics will help you understand the interplay between hardware, software, data, networks, and the people that use them.</p>
